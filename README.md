========
Jelly.js will be a modular node.js web framework to design web application.

Unlike most of node web frameworks, Jelly.js is not only for Single Page Applications (SPA) but also for traditional websites.

The main goal is to provide a system of module to reuse them later on.
The documentation can be found under the /documentation directory.

#### Current progress before the 1.0 version : **75%**
